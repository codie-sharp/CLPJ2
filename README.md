# Code Louisville Project 2 (CLPJ2)


User selects a template and will be asked questions on values to fill in and the result will be written to disk. The program will then ask if they'd like to do another. 

1. Master loop
    - Ask user after each template if they'd like to do another.
    - After applying 1 template, send to other recipients? 
        ? Multiple single emails and multiple recipients per each email ?
2. Loading template from disk.
    - Load templates from file and display name to user.
        ? User created template list (like contacts) or hard coded ?
3. Store dictionary
    - Store answers.
        ? What exactly is the dictionary ?
4. Unit test 
    - Test templates to match criteria. 
        ? What exactly is a unit test ?
